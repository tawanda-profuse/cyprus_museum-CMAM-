Museum Guide mobile application

This was my graduation project, a mobile application for a selected museum - The Cyprus Museum of Modern Arts. Makes use of the YouTube API to fetch videos from the museum's channel, also includes the Dialogflow API for basic conversation. 
There is a gallery with some pictures from the Museum's collection.
