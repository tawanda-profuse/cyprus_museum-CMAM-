# Museum Guide mobile application

A cross-platform mobile application that serves as a virtual exhibition for a museum.

## Background
This was my graduation project, a mobile application for a selected museum - **The Cyprus Modern Art Museum**. This project was implemented using Flutter.

## Features

- This project uses the YouTube API to fetch videos from the museum's channel and includes the Dialogflow API for basic conversation. 
- There is a gallery with some pictures from the Museum's collection.
